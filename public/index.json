This configuration focusing on using file providers as traefik configuration therefore the docker-compose.yaml looks clean. But as for the downside, you need to copy multiple files like the docker-compose.yaml and traefik.yaml as base configuration. Then the dynamic configuration files need to be created based on your needs.\nThis docker-compose.yaml file will create 2 containers; traefik and whoami service to test if this configuration working as we want.\nservices: traefik: image: traefik:latest restart: always environment: - \u0026#34;TZ=Asia/Jakarta\u0026#34; ports: - \u0026#34;80:80\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;443:443\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;8080:8080\u0026#34; volumes: - ./traefik.yaml:/etc/traefik/traefik.yaml - ./dynamic:/etc/traefik/dynamic - ./letsencrypt:/etc/traefik/letsencrypt healthcheck: test: [\u0026#34;CMD\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;traefik\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;healthcheck\u0026#34;] interval: 60s retries: 3 whoami: image: traefik/whoami restart: always This traefik.yaml file is the base configuration for traefik. It already includes HTTP Redirection to HTTPS, SSL Automatic Renewal, and automatic configuration discovery. Additional notes, if you want the dynamic configuration to be applied automatically, it should be referenced as a file inside providers.file.directory. If you add new directory inside it and put the configuration inside the child directory, then the automatic reload will not work.\nentryPoints: web: address: \u0026#34;:80\u0026#34; http: redirections: entryPoint: to: websecure scheme: https websecure: address: \u0026#34;:443\u0026#34; api: dashboard: true insecure: false debug: false ping: terminatingStatusCode: 204 log: format: json level: INFO accessLog: addInternals: true format: json filters: statusCodes: - \u0026#34;200\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;400-404\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;500-503\u0026#34; retryAttempts: true minDuration: \u0026#34;10ms\u0026#34; certificatesResolvers: letsencrypt: acme: email: \u0026#34;test@example.com\u0026#34; storage: \u0026#34;/etc/traefik/letsencrypt/acme.json\u0026#34; httpChallenge: entryPoint: web providers: file: directory: \u0026#34;/etc/traefik/dynamic\u0026#34; watch: true This is a basic dynamic configuration to route all request to domain example.com to be received by service-whoami\nhttp: routers: router-whoami: rule: \u0026#34;Host(`vps.episto.my.id`)\u0026#34; service: service-whoami services: service-whoami: loadBalancer: servers: - url: http://whoami:80 ","date":"31 August 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/traefik/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Traefik","type":"posts"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
